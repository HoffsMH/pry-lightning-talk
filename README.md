# Basic Pry stuff
## Basic neato's
Some random things I've found useful that can be used with pry out of the box.
* ``` whereami ``` to remember where you are in your code

* ```.<command> ``` executes terminal commands
  * ``` .ls ```
  * ``` .clear ```
  * ``` .git diff ```
  * ``` .git status ```
  * and yes we can get crazy ```.ruby <some-other-file> ```

and assuming your pry doesn't completely crash when an exception occurs because you are using pry-rescue.
* ``` wtf ``` and ``` wtf? ``` to display stack traces for an exception

* ``` cat -ex ``` to bring you to the line in your code where the exception occurs

* We can edit a file while in pry then continue to run through it with ```edit <filename> ```
  * but first we should probably set out editor with  
  ``` Pry.config.editor = 'atom'/'vim'/'whathaveyou' ```

  * or just include that line in ``` .pryrc ``` in our home directory


## Other Neato's
Cool ways of using pry.
* ``` binding.pry ``` is just ruby.

  So we can put a condition on whether or not it runs for when we know when something is going wrong but don't want to type exit 231 times.
  ```ruby
  [*1..1000].each do |element|
    if element == 232
      binding.pry
    end
  end
  ```
* We can also get pry to be the default debugger in rails by including ``` pry-rails``` instead of just ```pry``` in your gemfile

  ```ruby
  #gemfile
  group :development, :test do
    gem 'pry-rails'
  end
  ```

  ```bundle``` then type ```rails c ``` and you're in pry and not irb!


## Things to install and try
* ## [Pry-toys](https://github.com/ariabov/pry-toys)
  * For when you need to test something for yourself really quick. Really usefull for understanding enumerables.
    ```bash
     gem install pry-toys
     ```
     #### Try
     ```ruby
    Hash.toy(300) # creates a toy has
    Array.toy(3, Time) # creates a toy array of Time objects
     ```

* ## [Pry-byebug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/pry-byebug)
 * for stepping through code.
 Serves as a fine comb to step through and understand code one line at a time.
* was originally a fork of [pry-debugger](https://github.com/nixme/pry-debugger) which [doesn't work past Ruby version 2.x](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24395453/gem-install-debugger-error)
   ```bash
    gem install pry-byebug
    ```
    #### Try
    ```ruby
   step # Moves through code line by line
   continue # completes rest of code
    ```
* ## [Pry-rescue](https://github.com/ConradIrwin/pry-rescue)
  * from the author of this gem

    "start a pry session when something goes wrong"

    this is actually a two parter

   ```bash
    gem install pry-rescue
    gem install pry-stack_explorer
    ```
    both must be installed to work properly
    #### Try in shell
    ```bash
    rescue <problematic ruby file>
    ```
    #### and yes it can be used in rails
    ```bash
    rescue rails s
    ```
